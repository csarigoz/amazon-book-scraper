Dan Sullivan, the world's leading coach for highly successful entrepreneurs, wants you to know that achieving 10X growth is exponentially easier than striving for 2X growth. Most find this idea confusing at first because simply imagining 10X growth causes them to think they need to do 10X more work to achieve it. However, being a 10X entrepreneur is nothing like what most people think. 10X is not the outcome; it's a counterintuitive process you can apply every time you want exponential growth in your life and business. To make 10X possible, you must focus on expanding what Dan defines as your four most important freedoms\u2014time, money, relationship, and purpose. As your time becomes 10X more valuable, you increasingly multiply the money you earn both in terms of amount and profitable satisfaction. As money becomes a tool you can increasingly access with greater ease, you will engage with a growing number of other freedom-motivated individuals. As both your professional and personal life fills up with 10X more unique and collaborative relationships, you will realize that your most powerful purposes in all areas become 10X more lasting and positive for everyone involved. You will be impressed by what your life has become, and the meaning and impact you're having. 10X is fundamentally about quality vs quantity, and the quality of your freedoms determines the results you achieve.

In Big Lucky , Markham shares his gripping, authentic, and faith-based life journey to inspire others to pursue their goals. With five successful companies to his name and over $1.2 billion in combined retail sales, Jim Markham has made an indelible impact on the hair care industry. Across six decades, he has built a legacy of innovation that has forever changed how people care for their hair. But the path to success wasn't foregone, obvious, or easy. In his early years, nobody would have wagered on his success. Armed only with sheer determination and an unflappable confidence that he was meant for something bigger, Jim fought to make it from the bottom to the top - more than once. When the Manson murders gruesomely robbed him of his mentor and friend, superstar stylist Jay Sebring, Markham was thrust headlong into the high-flying celebrity culture of 1970s Hollywood. Taking on the mantle of the country's highest paid celebrity stylist, he counted luminaries such as Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman not only as clients, but dear friends. Raw, honest, and transparent, Markham shares the trials and triumphs that he encountered in life and business while building several global brands, including PureOlogy, ColorProof, and others. Jim's close friend and client Paul Newman once told him there are three kinds of luck in this world, \"Big luck, little luck, and no luck.\" Reflecting on his meteoric rise, Newman told Markham he was \"Big Lucky.\" But there\u2019s more to it than just luck.

His ability to adapt to change was demonstrated when he became the executive producer and star of Power , a high-octane, gripping crime drama centered around a drug kingpin's family. The series quickly became \"appointment\" television, leading to Jackson inking a four-year, $150 million contract with the Starz network - the most lucrative deal in premium cable history. Now, in his most personal audiobook, Jackson shakes up the self-help category with his unique, cutting-edge lessons and hard-earned advice on embracing change. Where The 50th Law tells listeners, \"Fear nothing and you shall succeed\", Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter builds on this message, combining it with Jackson's street smarts and hard-learned corporate savvy to help listeners successfully achieve their own comeback - and to learn to flow with the changes that disrupt their own lives.", "sales_rank": null, "link_to_all_reviews": "https://www.amazon.com/Hustle-Harder-Smarter/product-reviews/B07Z9JKFF2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&tag=cagrisarigo03-20"}

For decades we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F*ck positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let's be honest, shit is f*cked, and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is - a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited - \"not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault\". Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f*ck about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.", "sales_rank": null, "link_to_all_reviews": "https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/product-reviews/B01I29Y344/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&tag=cagrisarigo03-20"}

His only product is soon to be replaced by the silicon chip. Thirty years later, Miller sells his company for 18 million dollars. In Bootstrap Entrepreneur , you'll discover: The community spirit that defined post-war America Why business lessons from the 70s are as important today as they were back then How underserved communities can play a role in bringing back jobs from overseas What ethical leadership and a focus on quality can achieve Where the 20th-century tech revolution started (not in California!)

Across six decades, he has built a legacy of innovation that has forever changed how people care for their hair. But the path to success wasn't foregone, obvious, or easy. In his early years, nobody would have wagered on his success. Armed only with sheer determination and an unflappable confidence that he was meant for something bigger, Jim fought to make it from the bottom to the top - more than once. When the Manson murders gruesomely robbed him of his mentor and friend, superstar stylist Jay Sebring, Markham was thrust headlong into the high-flying celebrity culture of 1970s Hollywood. Taking on the mantle of the country's highest paid celebrity stylist, he counted luminaries such as Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman not only as clients, but dear friends. Raw, honest, and transparent, Markham shares the trials and triumphs that he encountered in life and business while building several global brands, including PureOlogy, ColorProof, and others. Jim's close friend and client Paul Newman once told him there are three kinds of luck in this world, \"Big luck, little luck, and no luck.\" Reflecting on his meteoric rise, Newman told Markham he was \"Big Lucky.\" But there\u2019s more to it than just luck.

Yet, like a lot of sayings, there is some distillation to be done before you can take the words at face value. Sure enough, you do not need fancy academic papers to succeed at business. You do not need to come from money to have a shot at being a successful entrepreneur. That\u2019s not all; there is no standard to adhere to, to make it in business.

To ensure you start on a good footing, this book will dissect the mindsets of some of the most successful people that have ever lived.

It sounds too good to be true, but this is the reality at Tunnel Vision, the clothing company that Madeline Pendleton built from the ground up. Like so many Americans, Madeline used to struggle to make ends meet. Raised by a punk dad and a goth mom in Fresno, California, she spent her teens intermittently homeless, relying on the kindness and spare couches of the local punk community to get by. By her twenties, she was drowning in student loans and credit card debt, working long hours and sick of her bosses treating her as disposable. Then her boyfriend, struggling with financial stress, died by suicide. Capitalism was literally killing her loved ones\u2014she knew there must be a better way. Madeline decided to study the rules of capitalism, the game everyone is forced to play. She used what she learned to build a new kind of business, one rooted in an ethos of community care. Millennials and Gen Zers like Madeline are facing an unprecedented financial reality: Stagnant wages, skyrocketing housing costs, a student debt crisis.

Oh, and took over Twitter. When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist. His father\u2019s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive. At the beginning of 2022\u2014after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth\u2014Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. \u201cI need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,\u201d he said. It was a wistful comment, not a New Year\u2019s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world\u2019s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground. For two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled with amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the question: are the demons that drive Musk also what it takes to drive innovation and progress?", "sales_rank": null, "link_to_all_reviews": null}

Do you know the benefits of having a Limited Liability Company (LLC) , but you don't know how to get started? Then your search is finally over, for we\u2019ve got the book for you ! The thought of \u201cbeing your own boss\u201d is sure exciting and if you plan to do it by setting up your business and are ready with a business plan , the next crucial step is deciding the right business structure. This decision has far reaching repercussions for the business and thus requires careful selection. The factors like personal liability , regulations, tax treatment , etc are governed by the form of your business entity which could be a Sole Proprietorship, Corporation, Partnership, or a Limited Liability Company (LLC). A limited liability company (LLC) can be the right choice for any business owner seeking to reduce liability and protect his or her assets . This type of entity has several advantages over operating a sole proprietorship or partnership. Unlike a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC shields the owner or owners from liability , and unlike a more complex corporation, management structure is loose, there is no board of directors to answer to, and with an LLC being a pass-through organization , no double taxation which corporations are subject to unless one elects to be taxed as a C or S corporation. In this book, you will discover the ins and outs of an LLC and find out if it\u2019s right for you. Here are just some of the topics that are discussed within this book : An introduction to what LLC actually means The advantages and disadvantages associated with LLC Easy steps towards starting your own LLC and LLC state specific guidelines to follow The accounting and taxes involved in this industry Reviewing whether LLC is right for you And so much more! Among all forms of companies, start-up of a LLC is easier with lesser complexities, paperwork and costs. This form of company comes with a lot of operational ease with less record keeping and compliance issues.

You have the right passion, the right business format and all the skills. But before making the leap of faith make sure you are ready in some other aspects as well. From starting the business to make it run smoothly requires a lot of dedication and sacrifice. Which means young or old, personal life will take some hits. Family and friends must be supportive as they must know what it takes to start a business and its effect on your family life. Lot of you may choose to have a job in the initial days of starting a business; this means all your spare time has to go for running the business. Entrepreneurship will take its toll on your health. Being lean and mean is great for business but that often means spending longer hours doing yourself what you would pay other people to do.

Along with knowing your strong points you also must know your comfort zones. Are you comfortable being the boss and having employees who are older than you? Dealing with the multiple personalities your employees possess? Handle money and take financial decisions? Getting into debt first for starting the business before seeing profits?

Terry Book Award, Academy of Management Entrepreneurs are among the primary shapers of our culture, yet their role in driving progress and influencing society has often been overlooked. As far back as we can trace human history, there have been entrepreneurs. Almost five millennia ago, copper tool manufacturers set up a factory in what today is southwest Spain, profiting for hundreds of years from trade around the Mediterranean. Papyri document the diverse investments of an ancient Egyptian businessperson, from grain-yielding land to flax for linen cloth. What do these figures have in common with renowned modern entrepreneurs, and how do their similarities help us achieve a deeper understanding of entrepreneurship as well as the potential for a healthier, wealthier, and more equitable and sustainable future? Derek Lidow delves into the deep history of innovation to deliver essential new insights into how entrepreneurs create value and bring about change. Telling the captivating stories of people from many different cultures over thousands of years, he shows how entrepreneurs transform the world through relentless innovation. Lidow demonstrates that far from being heroic lone individuals, they copy and then add to the inventions of others. The cumulative innovations of swarms of entrepreneurs expand the scale, scope, and range of products and services. Lidow emphasizes how entrepreneurship can harm society as well as benefit it, and he underscores ways to mitigate its harmful side and harness its positive effects. By highlighting the fundamental qualities of innovation throughout history, this book provides indispensable new perspective on how it is shaping our present and future.", "sales_rank": null, "link_to_all_reviews": "https://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Relentless-Quest-Value/product-reviews/0231199147?reviewerType=all_reviews&tag=cagrisarigo03-20"}

Anybody can get lucky. Nobody controls the odds like Billy Walters. Widely regarded as \u201cthe Michael Jordan of sports betting,\u201d Walters is a living legend in Las Vegas and among sports bettors worldwide. With an unmatched winning streak of thirty-six consecutive years, Walters has become fabulously wealthy by placing hundreds of millions of dollars a year in gross wagers, including one Super Bowl bet of $3.5 million alone. Competitors desperate to crack his betting techniques have tried hacking his phones, cloning his beepers, rifling through his trash, and bribing his employees. Now, after decades of avoiding the spotlight and fiercely protecting the keys to his success, Walters has reached the age where he wants to pass along his wisdom to future generations of sports wagerers. Gambler is more than a traditional autobiography. In addition to sharing his against-all-odds American dream story, Walters reveals in granular detail the secrets of his proprietary betting system, which will serve as a master class for anyone who wants to improve their odds at betting on sports. Walters also breaks his silence about his long and complicated relationship with Hall of Fame professional golfer Phil Mickelson. On a typical weekend gameday packed with college and pro sports, Walters will bet $10 million\u2014a small sum for someone as wealthy as he is today, but an unbelievable fortune for the child who was raised by his grandmother in extreme poverty in rural Kentucky. By the age of nine, Walters became a shark at hustling pool and pitching pennies. As a young adult, he set records as a used-car salesman, hustled golf, and dabbled in bookmaking. He eventually moved to Las Vegas, where he revolutionized sports betting strategy and became a member of the famed Computer Group, the first syndicate to apply sophisticated algorithms and data analysis to sports gambling. He became extraordinarily wealthy while overcoming addictions and outmaneuvering organized crime figures made infamous by Martin Scorsese\u2019s film Casino. In Gambler , Walters passes along everything he\u2019s learned about sports betting. First, he shows bettors how to mine the information we have at our fingertips to develop a sophisticated betting strategy and handicapping system of our own. He explains how even avid bettors often do not grasp all of the variables that go into making an informed wager\u2014factors such as home field advantage, individual player values, injuries or illness, weather forecasts, each team\u2019s previous schedule (bye weeks, multiple away games in a row, etc.), travel distance/difficulty, stadium quirks, turf types, and more. Not every bettor has access to Walters\u2019s team of expert analysts, but every bettor can follow his guidelines on how to measure the detailed information available online and look for unique situations that could affect a game\u2019s outcome more than usual. Variable by variable, Walters breaks down the formulas, point systems, and principles that he\u2019s developed over decades of improving his craft. A self-made man who\u2019s repeatedly won it all, lost it all, and earned it all back again, Walters has lived a singular and wildly appealing American life, of the outlaw variety. Gambler is at once a gripping autobiography, a blistering tell-all, and an indispensable playbook for coming out on top.", "sales_rank": null, "link_to_all_reviews": "https://www.amazon.com/Gambler-Secrets-Life-at-Risk/product-reviews/1668032856?reviewerType=all_reviews&tag=cagrisarigo03-20"}

But why? Entrepreneurs often lose sight of what matters . Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn't that enough? Derek Sivers accidentally started a business by helping musicians sell their music. It became the largest online seller of independent music with over 150,000 musicians and $100M in sales. After ten years, he sold the company for $22 million and gave all the money to charity. In \"Anything You Want\" he shares 40 powerful lessons, in a book you can read in about an hour. Points include: When you make a company, you make your utopia - your perfect world. Business is not about money. It's about making dreams come true for others and for yourself. Starting with no money is an advantage. You don't need money to start helping people. Your business plan is moot . You don't know what people really want until you launch. Don't pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help . By focusing entirely on thrilling your customers - even at an occasional loss - you ultimately profit more, because of the loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing that comes only when you place your customer's needs over your own . The book's most memorable stories are from his horrible mistakes, like why saving ten minutes cost him $3.3 million dollars , and how he was attacked by Steve Jobs . \"Anything You Want\" was first published by Seth Godin in 2011, then by Penguin/Portfolio in 2015. This third edition for 2022 was improved with eight new chapters . Its surprisingly humanist approach to business, focusing on generosity and happiness more than profits, has helped thousands of entrepreneurs to re-focus on what matters and find their own path to success.", "sales_rank": null, "link_to_all_reviews": null}

Stylist to the stars and award-winning serial entrepreneur, Jim Markham embodies the mantra: You are made to win! In Big Lucky , Markham shares his gripping, authentic, and faith-based life journey to inspire others to pursue their goals. With five successful companies to his name and over $1.2 billion in combined retail sales, Jim Markham has made an indelible impact on the hair care industry. Across six decades, he has built a legacy of innovation that has forever changed how people care for their hair. But the path to success wasn't foregone, obvious, or easy. In his early years, nobody would have wagered on his success. Armed only with sheer determination and an unflappable confidence that he was meant for something bigger, Jim fought to make it from the bottom to the top - more than once. When the Manson murders gruesomely robbed him of his mentor and friend, superstar stylist Jay Sebring, Markham was thrust headlong into the high-flying celebrity culture of 1970s Hollywood. Taking on the mantle of the country's highest paid celebrity stylist, he counted luminaries such as Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman not only as clients, but dear friends. Raw, honest, and transparent, Markham shares the trials and triumphs that he encountered in life and business while building several global brands, including PureOlogy, ColorProof, and others. Jim's close friend and client Paul Newman once told him there are three kinds of luck in this world, \"Big luck, little luck, and no luck.\" Reflecting on his meteoric rise, Newman told Markham he was \"Big Lucky.\" But there\u2019s more to it than just luck.

For many in Cold War America, these magazines served as an initiation into an extensive world of photography studios, mail-order catalogs, pen-pal services, and book clubs, targeting a gay market.

It reveals how Bob Mizer founded Physique Pictorial in Los Angeles as a direct response to postal authority intimidation. It uncovers the story of The Grecian Guild, founded by a gay couple who met at the University of Virginia, who offered their subscribers access to a gay fraternal order. It tells the story of a New York publishing executive who pioneered the notion of niche marketing of gay books. It tells the story of Elsie Carlton, a straight woman who ran one of the nation's first gay mail-order book clubs. Threatening all these\u00a0physique\u00a0entrepreneurs was Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield, who had members of the first gay pen pal service arrested and sent its founders to prison. It would take Lynn Womack, who consolidated the field into a physique publishing empire--including his own distribution network, printing plant, and legal library--to take his case to the U.S. Supreme Court and win one of the first and most\u00a0important\u00a0gay rights cases. Manual v. Day in 1962\u00a0paved the way for a vibrant gay print and commercial world that could help sustain a movement.

As a group, they have driven twenty-first-century innovation and entrepreneurship. Their names stir passions; they\u2019re as controversial as they are admired. Yet for all their influence, the story of where they first started has gone largely untold. Before igniting the commercial space race or jumpstarting social media\u2019s rise, they were the unknown creators of a scrappy online payments start-up called PayPal. In building what became one of the world\u2019s foremost companies, they faced bruising competition, internal strife, the emergence of widespread online fraud, and the devastating dot-com bust of the 2000s.

Stylist to the stars and award-winning serial entrepreneur, Jim Markham embodies the mantra: You are made to win! In Big Lucky , Markham shares his gripping, authentic, and faith-based life journey to inspire others to pursue their goals. With five successful companies to his name and over $1.2 billion in combined retail sales, Jim Markham has made an indelible impact on the hair care industry. Across six decades, he has built a legacy of innovation that has forever changed how people care for their hair. But the path to success wasn't foregone, obvious, or easy.

Taking on the mantle of the country's highest paid celebrity stylist, he counted luminaries such as Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman not only as clients, but dear friends. Raw, honest, and transparent, Markham shares the trials and triumphs that he encountered in life and business while building several global brands, including PureOlogy, ColorProof, and others.

In his early years, nobody would have wagered on his success. Armed only with sheer determination and an unflappable confidence that he was meant for something bigger, Jim fought to make it from the bottom to the top - more than once. Born into poverty in the barren oil towns of New Mexico to an absent father and an abusive, alcoholic mother, divorced twice with two children by age 20, Jim started cutting hair at age 15 to make ends meet. Within a few short years, his talent and drive propelled him to become the protege of the world's top celebrity stylist. When the Manson murders gruesomely robbed him of his mentor and friend, superstar stylist Jay Sebring, Markham was thrust headlong into the high-flying celebrity culture of 1970s Hollywood. Taking on the mantle of the country's highest paid celebrity stylist, he counted luminaries such as Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman not only as clients, but dear friends. At the peak of his early success, Markham lost it all to unscrupulous business partners and a catastrophic addiction to cocaine, which nearly cost him his life. Homeless and penniless, his belief in himself and vision fueled him as he built it all back, 100 times over. Jim went on to build more successful companies and pioneer the sulfate-free movement. In 2007, his company PureOlogy sold to L'Oreal for a record $280 million. Today, Markham continues his legacy of innovation, bringing to market groundbreaking products which are silicone-free, 100 percent vegan, certified hypoallergenic, and packaged in 100 percent recycled plastics.
